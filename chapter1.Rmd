**Great** to be here! I anm very excited abou this course. I feel that data analysis is taught way too little to bachelor and master students. I have grauated from environmental ecology and we had only one mandatory data analysis course where we went though only the basics of SPSS. Nevertheless, in my Master's theses I was put up againts R! I had a lot of help from one of ou department's PhD student but there was also a lot I had to figure out on my own.But I maid it and now I am happy to learn more!
